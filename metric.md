# 13 Key Restaurant Numbers and Metrics that Impact Profits
Are you tracking these restaurant numbers? Here are the important restaurant metrics you need to know to maintain and grow your business.


The basics 
These baseline numbers will help you calculate more advanced restaurant metrics. 

Total sales 
Your total sales are your on-premise, delivery, and pickup sales combined. Find your delivery and pickup sales in the Merchant Portal, and add them to your on-premise sales. Or, with a point of sale (POS) integration, you can see all of your sales together in one place. 

    Total Sales = On-premise Sales + Delivery Sales + Pickup Sales 

Cost of goods sold (CoGS)
Cost of Goods Sold is essentially how much every item on your menu costs to create. The first step to determining your CoGS is keeping track of your inventory on a monthly business. You’ll calculate CoGS using the value of your inventory at the beginning of the month, the value at the end, and any inventory purchases made during the month.

    Cost of Goods Sold = Beginning Inventory + Purchased Inventory - Final Inventory

Labor cost and labor cost percentage
Labor costs include salaried labor, hourly wages and other employee-related expenses like workers’ compensation, benefits, taxes, and insurance. You can calculate labor cost percentage by looking at labor as a percentage of sales or as a percentage of total operating costs.

    Labor = Salaried Labor + Hourly Wages + Employee-related Expenses

    Labor Cost Percentage (as a Percent of Sales) = [Labor Costs / Total Sales] x 100

    Labor Cost Percentage (as a Percent of Costs) = [Labor Costs / Total Operating Costs] x 100

Fixed costs
Fixed costs are costs that generally don’t change from month to month, like rent, mortgage, salaries, loan payments, license fees, or insurance premiums. 

Variable costs 
Variable costs like food, hourly wages, and utilities are more likely to fluctuate from month to month, though after a while they become easier to predict depending on season or time of year. 

Key restaurant metrics 
Use the basics to calculate these metrics and start to gauge the health of your business. 

Prime cost 
Prime cost is the amount of money it takes to run your business on a daily basis. Find it by adding together your labor costs and your cost of goods sold. Typically about 60% of total sales, prime cost is a helpful metric to keep track of because it involves costs within your control (unlike rent).

    Prime Cost = Labor + COGS

Gross profit margin
Your gross profit is your total sales minus your COGS and labor cost. Your gross profit margin is a percentage that helps you determine how efficiently you’re managing your operations and sales. The higher your gross profit margin, the better. If your gross profit margin is a little low, it may be an indication that sales are lower, efficiency could be improved, or your pricing model needs some tweaking. 

    Gross Profit Margin = [(Total Sales - CoGs - Labor)/Total Sales] x 100 

Net profit margin
When people talk about profit margins, they’re usually talking about net profit margins. Your net profit is your total sales minus all costs: COGS, labor, and all other fixed and variable expenses. Your net profit margin tells you exactly what percentage of your total revenue is profit. For restaurants, net profit margins range from 0-15%, with most restaurants falling in the 3-5% range.  

    Net Profit Margin = [(Total Sales - CoGs - Labor)/Total Sales] x 100

Food cost percentage
Your food cost percentage is the difference between how much an item costs to make and how much you are selling it for. Although this percentage will vary based on the item, this metric can help you identify which items are the most profitable. Once you know that, you can use the Merchant Portal to prominently feature those items on your DoorDash menu. 

In addition to figuring out the food cost percentage for individual items, you can also calculate the overall food cost percentage for your entire menu, which is typically somewhere between 28 and 35%.

    Food Cost Percentage = Item Cost / Selling Price 

Break even
A useful metric for new and established restaurants, your break even point is how much food you have to sell each month to break even and start turning a profit.

    Break Even Point = Total Fixed Costs ÷ ( (Total Sales - Total Variable Costs) / Total Sales)
